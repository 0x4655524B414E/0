Attempting to implement Chess using C++ OOP.

Project used to rely on getting input from keyboard printing characters to the terminal.
Now attempting to implement a graphical interface using SFML 2.6.1 library.
Compatible compiler with SFML 2.6.1 : GCC 13.1.0 MinGW (SEH) - 64-bit

Satranc.cpp file is before i tried to implement graphical interface.
main.cpp has nothing important or related to the project.

only improve.cpp is added to cmake since all the source code is there.

CURRENT SITUATION
It compiles and runs. 
The issue is that the opening window is completely blank for some reason.
Couldn't find what the reason is since this is my first time implementing a graphical interface.

Any help and improvement is appreciated.
